# Maze Generation using Recursive backtracking

I was learning maze generation for my next game so I decided to use p5js to make a simple maze generator using recursive backtracking algotithm. I'll soon upload a unity project too.

## How to use?

- Open the index.html file in your browser and a maze will generate right in front of you.

- You can change the canvas size and cell size in sketch.
